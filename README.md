# Executor

To use this feature, all you need to do is to create Main.java/.kt file (it is recommended to create
it in an empty folder), then open it, a dialog will show asking you if you want to use a sample
code, click Yes. Now you can run you code by clicking run button in the toolbar. The main method
gives you the context and the folder where the Main.java/.kt is located.

You can add java files to the same directory. You can also add .dex/.jar files to the same directory
if you want to use additional libraries.

After running the code, an output folder will be created. In this folder, you can see the output dex file(s), you
can run these dex files directly without the need to compile your code, all you need to do is to rename them 
to any name that ends with .exe.dex (e.g. classes.exe.dex, classes2.exe.dex,.. etc).
Using this features, the possibilities are endless, and you can create any extension you want and makes part of the app!.
