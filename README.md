# Executor

To use this feature, all you need to do is to create Main.java/.kt file (it is recommended to create
it in an empty folder), then open it, a dialog will show asking you if you want to use a sample
code, click Yes. Now you can run you code by clicking run button in the toolbar. The main method
gives you the context and the folder where the Main.java/.kt is located.

You can add additional java files to the same directory, and if you want to use a local library, create a folder and name it `libs`,
then put all JARs and DEXs here.

After running the code, an output folder will be created. In this folder, you can see the output `.extension` file(s), you
can run these files directly without the need to compile your code again by clicking on `classes.extension`.
Using this features, the possibilities are endless, and you can create any extension you want and use it as part of the app!.
